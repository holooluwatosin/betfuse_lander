          <h3>Akin Owolabi, PhD. Medical & Nutrition Advisor</h3>
          <img class="drimg" src="./Drd-281x300 (1).jpg" alt="dr Akin">
          <p>Not being happy with the current state of affairs in modern healthcare, Dr. Akin decided to leave the normal
            world of medicine to find out natural means to living healthy.</p>
          <p>He grew frustrated with “the system” which didn’t allow much for natural alternative remedies – even though
            he
            knew they were more effective with no side effects, and decided to study the Indian’s natural medical
            practices –
            which earned them the “leaders” in healthcare worldwide.</p>
          <p>He is now the director of Janis Nutraceuticals, which balances conventional medicine with natural alternative
            healing modalities to achieve optimal wellness.</p>
